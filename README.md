# Classical Snake Game

## Description

This project implements a classical Snake game using Pygame on a 15x15 grid. The game features intelligent movement powered by the A* algorithm with a Manhattan distance-based heuristic for optimized pathfinding. Key functionalities include collision handling, grid visualization, and dynamic food placement.
